# README

Recently I have started using mind maps as a technique for the process of documenting new technologies, domains, projects and requirements and have found this an extremely useful tool for gathering large sum's of information in a short period of time for quick reference and memory retention.

In this repo you will find a number of mind maps I have published publicly for the enjoyment of anyone thats interested.

All mind maps are build using the [Xmind community edition](https://www.xmind.net/xmind8-pro/)
